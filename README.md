# Tradecore_py

#### TO THE PERSON REVIEWING THIS:

I made this as I thought it should be made.
The program stops when every post is liked or when each bot hits its limit. 
The reason why I didnt upload just the app was because of settings in the 
main project folder.You will need to run manage.py migtate before testing

The Hunter API key and Clearbit's API key are both in TC_task/settings.py
This took no longer than 7-8 hours.
